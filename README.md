GameEngine
==============

(Working title)

I was inspired by Itay Keren's work on Mushroom 11, particularly with vertex mapped bodies for simplified soft body physics here http://itaykeren.tumblr.com/post/64889060446/vertex-mapped-bodies . This is an attempt to get my engine up to snuff so I can do cool stuff like this.
