Current higher pri:
- Burgermaking minigame time!
- Ship stops suddenly when moving joystick slowly towards center position
- Look into ETC1/DXT compression for images
- Particles follow ship with acceleration applied
- Along the same vein, particles are affected by framerate
- Use level editor to create geometry/scenery
- Fix tamerisk board
- Test bg sfx
- 3D models die on context change/resolution change

Bugs:
- Crashes sometimes on load
- Framerate spikes
- Particle editor breaks after F5

- Game pauses slightly when loading sound; why?
	- Has to hit pak; but already loaded
	- Loaded from memory
	- ogg format slowing it down? Need some better stream?
	- Load sfx up front?

Possible sound channels:
- BGM
- SFX
- Environmental SFX
- System SFX
- Voice
- Bg voice
- Movie

Overall TODO list:
- Look up const declarations for variables and see if that helps optimize in C
- Curve editor via ImGUI
- Resources should be streamed from disk, not loaded upfront from .pak files
- Sound filters
- Sound pitch
- Fix math for softbody lattice anim so it actually works properly
- Use GLM for math stuff instead of glPushMatrix() and friends
- Implement newer OpenGL shaders
- Use shaders rather than lattice animations where possible
- rip out displaylists for 3D objects and use vertex buffers instead
- Revisit class predeclaration and add more where possible
- Ortho for HUD and text drawing
- Create allocator / choose one to use rather than mixing malloc & new
- Particle systems, objects, etc should be loaded by template, not from XML each time
- Move object self-creation into resource loaders where applicable
- Error checking of parameters in luafuncs.cpp (without breaking everything this time)

Particle System Editing:
- Fix image rect preview
- UI should save/load window booleans as config
- Re - add death spawn types (tho prolly on a per-system basis?)
- Add particle support for emitter acceleration
- Fix other TODO items in particle UI and saving
- Add support for seeing particle death spawns
- Add rotation angle for setting rotation based on velocity (so you don't have to image edit for a particle problem)


Refactoring thoughts:
- Image class is bloated with too much junk; once shaders are implemented see what can be cropped out
- lots of classes are in files for other classes; move to own files


Lower priority:
- Test sound pitch shifting; current implementation seems to not work for all sound effects as intended
- "Press Any Key" in games is used to determine which controller to use (though this should be stored, which most games don't do)
- UTF code point lookup should use array of direct values rather than binary search?
- Use SDL_GetPowerInfo() for laptop battery reminders
- Move all resource loading stuff to IO?
- Stream areas as needed vs. load maps?

Reasoning behind the engine design (aka why not just use Unity or whatever):
- Robust Lua scripting interface
- 3D either fleshed out more fully (with sub-objects, object demolition) or ripped out
	-- Don't want to bother with bones/3D animation; math too complicated. Does this make the 3D too limited?
	-- How much do I care about 3D eye candy and does that just make the 2D stuff look like crap?
- Simplified resource managment
	-- Paged in with memory mapping if intelligent enough for performance gains
- XML vs. Lua - when to use one over the other? Can XML be removed intelligently?
- Optimization and data-driven programming/design where applicable
- I had a look at Unity; it sucks all the joy out of game development
	- Low-level code (the fun part) is replaced with high-level APIs to learn. Learning APIs is not fun, and never will be.
	- Actual learning as a whole is removed; you won't learn anything practical from learning Unity
	- No programming experience is required in Unity; any old artist can throw something together that will look better. Lack of art skill will become the major limiting factor.
	- Unity uses C#. C# is a terrible language made by novices, for novices
	- The "portability" aspect is thrown out the window when optimization is difficult. New Unity projects can't be ported to Vita. Old ones could, but were incredibly impossible to optimize (because C#). In essence, using a "more portable" platform prevents actual portability, and optimizing per-system is nigh on impossible. A render method that's fast on one system may be impossibly slow on another, and Unity can't take this into account as well as a well-designed, lower-level engine can (because C#).
